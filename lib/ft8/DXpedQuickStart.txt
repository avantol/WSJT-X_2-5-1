		Quick Start for DXpedition Mode
		-------------------------------

These notes are intended for operators already familiar with WSJT-X
and FT8 mode.  QSOs between the Dxpedition ("Fox") and other stations
("Hounds") are completed with as little as one transmission per Hound,
as in the following examples:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Fox (300-600 Hz)                 Hounds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  CQ KH1DX AJ10
2.                                   KH1DX K1ABC FN42, KH1DX W9XYZ EN37, ...
3.  K1ABC KH1DX -13
4.                                   KH1DX K1ABC R-11
5.  K1ABC RR73; W9XYZ <KH1DX> -17
6.                                   KH1DX W9XYZ R-16
7.  W9XYZ RR73; G4AAA <KH1DX> -09
8.  ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everybody sets dial frequency to an agreed number and uses CAT control
with Split Operation (either *Rig* or *Fake It*).  Fox transmits up to
5 signals simultaneously, at audio frequencies 300, 360, ... 540
Hz.  Hounds make initial calls (e.g., line 2 above) anywhere in the
range 1000 - 4000 Hz.  They send "R+rpt" 350 Hz above the frequency
where Fox called them.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR FOX
--------------------

1. Start WSJT-X in FT8 mode.  Select *Fox* on the *Settings ->
Advanced tab*.  On the main window, check *Tx even/1st*, *Auto Seq*,
and *Hold Tx Freq*; uncheck *Call 1st*.  Set *Tx 300 Hz* and select
Tab 3.

2. In Fox mode the left window (called "Band Activity" in normal FT8
mode) is labeled "Stations calling DXpedition <MyCall>".  It will be
filled with a sorted list of calling Hounds.  You can sort by Call,
Grid, S/N, Distance, or Random order by using the comboBox at top
right of Tab 3.  You can limit the displayed Hound callsigns to those
no stronger than *Max dB*.  Fox might use this feature to discourage
Hounds from engaging in a QRO arms race.

3. *N Slots* sets the number of simultaneous Fox signals to be used.
Fox carries out as many as *N Slots* QSOs simultaneously.

4. *Repeats* sets the maximum number of repeat transmissions of the
same message.  A QSO is aborted when this number would be exceeded.

5. The *CQ* comboBox on Tab 3 offers a selection of directed CQ
messages.  *Reset* clears the QSO queue.

6. The Fox operator's main task is to select Hounds to be called and
worked.  The text box on Tab 3 holds the "QSO queue": a list of Hound
calls to be worked.  Hit Enter to select the top callsign from the
sorted list of callers (left window), or double-click on any
particular call.  Either actiion moves that Hound into the "QSO
queue".

7. The right window displays decodes of signals below 1000 Hz.
Normally these should include only Hound messages containing "R+rpt"
and Fox's own transmissions.

8. To get things started, toggle *Enable Tx* to red.  If a Hound call
is available in the QSO queue, that station will be called.  If the
QSO queue is empty, Fox calls CQ.

9. If you're using Nslots = 2 or higher, your signal no longer has
a constant envelope.  To avoid producing intermod sidebands you need
to ensure linearity in your Tx system.  One way to get things about right
is to use the WSJT-X *Tune* button to generate a pure tone.  Reduce the
Tx audio level until your power output decreases by 10% or so.  Use this
level for your Fox transmissions.

NOTE: If you are generating Nslots signals, the average power in each one
will be 1/Nslots^2 of its normal value for single-signal transmissions.

Nslots  Relative dB
-------------------
  1        0
  2       -6
  3      -9.5
  4      -12
  5      -14


The following features are not yet implemented for Fox:

1. Enforce all required settings
2. Tx message timeout
3. Manual abort of selected QSO
4. All Tx and Rx messages to all.txt
5. Additional sort criteria for Hound calls
6. Selectable timeout for keeping Hounds in the sorted list
7. Display number of active callers
8. Display QSO rate


INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOUND
----------------------

1. Start WSJT-X in FT8 mode.  Select *Hound* On the *Settings ->
Advanced* tab.  On the main window check *Auto Seq* and uncheck *Tx
even/1st*, *Call 1st*, and *Hold Tx Freq*.  Set *Tx nnnn Hz* to some
frequency between 1000 and 4000 Hz, and select *Tab 1*.  Enter Fox's
callsign and locator in DX Call and DX Grid, select Tx1, and start
*Monitor*.

2. When you have copied Fox, hit *Enable Tx* to call him.  You may
keep calling until he answers.  You may wish to move your TxFreq
around, hoping to find a clear calling frequency.

3. When you are called by Fox with a signal report, your next
transmission will automatically be sent as Tx3 ("R+rpt").  When Fox
receives that message he responds with "RR73", and your QSO is
complete!


The following features are not yet implemented for Hound:

1. Force all required settings
2. React properly to directed CQs from Fox
3. Disable Tx2, 4, 5, 6
4. For Tx1, enforce TxFreq >= 1000 Hz
