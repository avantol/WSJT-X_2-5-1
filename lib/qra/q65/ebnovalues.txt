# Eb/No Values to be used during the Q65 codec simulation
# Each line of this file indicates the Eb/No value to be simulated (in dB) 
# and the number of errors that should be detected by the decoder
# 
# Be careful that the simulation takes a long time to complete
# if the number of errors is large for the specified Eb/No
# (this is particularly true if AP decoding is used)
