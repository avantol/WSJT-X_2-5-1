.Decode Highlighting

* _WSJT-X_ uses colors to highlight decoded CQ messages of particular
  interest.  Check the box *Show DXCC, grid, and worked-before status*
  on the *Settings | General* tab, and any boxes of interest to you on
  the *Colors* tab.  You can drag any line up or down to raise or
  lower its logical priority.  Right-click any line to set a new
  foreground or background color.  Foreground and background colors
  are applied separately, and careful choices of foreground,
  background, and priority can provide two indications of
  worked-before status.

* Press the *Reset Highlighting* button to reset all of the color
  settings to default values.

* Check *Highlight by Mode* if you wish worked before status to be per
  <<INTRO,mode>>.

* Check *Only grid Fields sought* if you are only interested in the
  leading two character grid locator Fields rather than teh four
  character grid locator Squares.

* Check *Include extra WAE entities* if you are interested in the
  extra entities defined for DARC WAE and CQ Marathon awards.

* Worked before status is calculated from your _WSJT-X_ ADIF
  <<LOGGING, Logging>> file, you may replace ADIF log file with one
  exported from your station logging application, *Rescan ADIF Log*
  rebuilds the _WSJT-X_ worked before indexes using the current ADIF
  log file.

TIP: The _WSJT-X_ ADIF file records must contain the "CALL" field.
     The "BAND", and "MODE", and "GRIDSQUARE" fields are optional
     depending on your DXing objectives. DXCC entity, continent, CQ,
     and ITU Zone data for call prefixes and certain well known
     overrides are derived from the cty.dat database which is bundled
     with _WSJT-X_ (See <<LOGGING,Logging>> for details).

.Logbook of The World User Validation

Stations who are known to have uploaded their logs to the ARRL LoTW
QSL matching service can be highlighted. The data used to determine
this is available online.

* *Fetch Now* will download a fresh dataset from the *Users CSV file
   URL*. The LoTW team normally update this data weekly.

* Adjust *Age of last upload less than* to set the period within
  which a station must have uploaded their log to LoTW to trigger
  highlighting.
