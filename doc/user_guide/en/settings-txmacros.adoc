- To add a new message to the list, enter the desired text (up to 13
characters) in the entry field at top, then click *Add*.

- To remove an unwanted message, click on the message and then on
*Delete*.

- You can reorder your macro messages by using drag-and-drop. The
new order will be preserved when _WSJT-X_ is restarted.

- Messages can also be added from the main window's *Tx5*
  field. Simply hit [Enter] after the message has been entered.
