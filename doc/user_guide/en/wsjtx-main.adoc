left margin and select the appropriate package for your operating
system.

[[CONFIG]] 
== Settings

Select *Settings* from the *File* menu or by typing *F2*.  (On
Macintosh select *Preferences* from the _WSJT-X_ menu, or use the
keyboard shortcut *Cmd+,*).  The following sections describe setup
options available on eight tabs selectable near the top of the window.

[[DARK_STYLE]]
=== Dark Style

An optional *Dark* style is available.  To make it effective you will
probably want to redefine your color settings.  In Windows or Linux,
start the program from a command-prompt window using the following
command, or modify the _WSJT-X_ desktop shortcut accordingly:

 wsjtx --stylesheet :/qdarkstyle/style.qss

In macOS, enter the following command from a terminal:

 open /Applications/wsjtx.app --args -stylesheet :/qdarkstyle/style.qss

In Linux using the Unity or GNOME GUI the following commands will
update the _WSJT-X_ start up:

....
sed '/Exec=wsjtx/ s/$/ -stylesheet :\/qdarkstyle\/style.qss/' \
  /usr/share/applications/wsjtx.desktop >~/.local/share/applications/wsjtx.desktop
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
....

Depending on your operating system, the main _WSJT-X_ window will look
something like this:
