// These instructions are up-to-date for WSJT-X v2.2

*macOS10.13* and later: Download the file {osx} to your desktop,
double-click it and consult its `ReadMe` file for important
installation notes.  

If you have already installed a previous version, you can retain it by
changing its name in the *Applications* folder (such as from _WSJT-X_ to
_WSJT-X_2.2_).  You can then proceed to the installation phase.

Take note also of the following:

* Use the Mac's *Audio MIDI Setup* utility to configure your sound
card for 48000 Hz, two-channel, 16-bit format.

NOTE: If you are using macOS with an external audio device and find
that Tx audio spontaneously switches to the motherboard sound device
after a few transmissions, try setting the sample rate to 44100 Hz
rather than the otherwise recommended 48000 Hz.

* Use *System Preferences* to select an external time source to keep
your system clock synchronized to UTC.

* To uninstall simply drag the _WSJT-X_ application from *Applications* 
to the *Trash Can*.
