- _Logging_: Choose any desired options from this group.  Operators in
a multi-operator station may wish to enter their home callsign as *Op
Call*.

- _Network Services_: Check *Enable PSK Reporter Spotting* to send
reception reports to the {pskreporter} mapping facility.

- _UDP Server_: This group of options controls the network name or
address and port number used to exchange information with a third
party application that interoperates with _WSJT-X_.  Exchanged
information includes decoded messages, general program status, QSOs
logged, highlighting of callsigns in the _WSJT-X_ band activity
window, and limited facilities to initiate QSOs in response to CQ or
QRZ messages. Full details of the protocol can be found in comments
at the top of this file in our source code repository:
https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/wsjtx/ci/master/tree/Network/NetworkMessage.hpp

NOTE: The *Outgoing interfaces* and *Multicast TTL* fields are only
      present when a multicast group IP address has been entered in
      the *UDP Server* field.

Programs like _JTAlert_ use the _UDP Server_ feature to obtain
information about running _WSJT-X_ instances.  If you are using
_JTAlert_ to control _WSJT-X_, be sure to check the
*Accept UDP requests* box.
