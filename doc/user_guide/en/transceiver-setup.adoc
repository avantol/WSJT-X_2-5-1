.Receiver Noise Level

- If it is not already highlighted in green, click the *Monitor*
  button to start normal receive operation.

- Be sure your transceiver is set to *USB* (or *USB Data*) mode.

- Use the receiver gain controls and/or the computer's audio mixer
  controls to set the background noise level (scale at lower left of
  main window) to around 30 dB when no signals are present.  It is
  usually best to turn AGC off or reduce the RF gain control to
  minimize AGC action.

TIP: The PC audio mixer normally has two sliders, one for each
     application attached which should be set to maximum (0dB FS) as
     it cannot help with distortion from overly high or low input
     levels from your receiver and another *Master* level which is
     analogue attenuator on the sound card before the Analogue to
     Digital Converter (ADC). The *Master* level can be used to adjust
     the signal level received by _WSJT-X_.

.Bandwidth and Frequency Setting

- If your transceiver offers more than one bandwidth setting in USB
  mode, it may be advantageous to choose the widest one possible, up
  to about 5 kHz. 

- If you have only a standard SSB filter you won’t be able to display
  more than about 2.7 kHz bandwidth.  Depending on the exact dial
  frequency setting, on HF bands you can display the full sub-band
  generally used for one mode.

.Transmitter Audio Level

* Click the *Tune* button on the main screen to switch the radio into
  transmit mode and generate a steady audio tone.

* Listen to the generated audio tone using your radio’s *Monitor*
  facility. The transmitted tone should be perfectly smooth, with no
  clicks or glitches.  Make sure that this is true even when you
  simultaneously use the computer to do other tasks such as email, web
  browsing, etc..

* Adjust the *Pwr* slider (at right edge of main window) downward from
  its maximum until the RF output from your transmitter falls
  slightly.  This is generally a good level for audio drive.

* Toggle the *Tune* button once more or click *Halt Tx* to stop your
  test transmission.
