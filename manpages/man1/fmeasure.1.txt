== NAME

fmeasure - Calculates the properly calibrated frequency of a series of test signals

== SYNOPSIS

*fmeasure* ['FILE']

== DESCRIPTION

*fmeasure* is one of suite of command line tools designed to aid
frequency measurement. These tools are aimed at those taking part in
the ARRL FMT, but are also useful for general frequency measurement
and calibration. They are included within the *WSJT-X* package for use
with the FreqCal mode of WSJT-X.

The input FILE is normally the output of the *fmtavg*(1) tool, after
adjusting to remove bad sources. Results are saved in 'fmeasure.out'
and are suitable for entry to the ARRL Frequency Measuring Test (FMT).
